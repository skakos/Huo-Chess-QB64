Huo Chess: The best open-source micro chess program to use for educational purposes!

Overview: A mini open source chess program for educational purposes (the latest Java version is 48 KB in size, while the latest C# console version is only 159 KB is size, even though it utilizes the latest .NET Platform). Code is purposefully heavily commented and kept as concise as possible; no size-reducing optimizations are applied that would make the code less readable. Articles explaining the chess engine algorithm exist either here or in Harmonia Philosophica site.

How to use Huo Chess Opening Editor: Simply open the program and make moves. All moves entered are stored in separate txt files which will serve as the opening book of the chess program. Each txt file holds a chessboard position and the move you played in that position. In case there is already a suggested move for a specific position the program will let you know and the new move played will not be documented again (you will have to delete the relevant txt file to record a different move). If you wish the program to use the opening book you have created (i.e. all the txt files generated with the process mentioned above) simply put all these txt files in the same folder as the executable program (at the same path level, not in a separate folder). Note that for distribution purposes only, the opening book txt files are packaged in a separate folder, so in order to use them you must copy and paste them in the same folder as the executable file.
